# Super Human Game

## Abstract

Since childhood exercise is a common activity in human life, either for fun or discipline, however recently this has changed because of the life and alimentation style of new generations, a OECD projections show a steady increase in obesity rates until at least 2030 in several countries [1], to reduce this problem we purpose a laser tag game, in this work we purpose the next dynamic, the user can be able to play in teams, with a limit of 3 users,  the user will shoot a laser gun with a pneumatic gel muscles attached in the arms, this will provide the feeling or sensation of shooting a real arm, in another hand also the shoots that impact the user can be felt, in addition an EMS sensor is used to bring special features to the user as a super gun, each game package contains as well a small tank of compressed air to drive the soft actuators (pneumatic gel muscles), and a small power bank. all the results will be displayed in an interface. With this system we want to encourage users, kids and adult people, to practice exercise.
